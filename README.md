# myESANet

This repository contains code which is a paper implementation of "Efficient RGB-D Semantic Segmentation for Indoor Scene Analysis" ([IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561675),  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06961.pdf)).

Based on the paper, I carefully implemented the network architecture on [NYUv2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html) and [SUNRGB-D](https://rgbd.cs.princeton.edu/) and perform inference and test performance on edge devices(NVIDIA Jeton Nano).

This repository contains the code for training, evaluating, inference and deploying ESANet. As for deploying ESANet, I decide to deploy model in edge device by TensorRT and ONNX, as well as for measuring the inference time.
